## About
The website is a trading simulator that replicates a real trading platform, allowing beginner traders to learn about trading in a risk-free environment. A free NASDAQ stock market API is integrated to fetch live and historical stock data and is updated periodically throughout the day.  

In regards to implementation, we use **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** for client-side rendering, and **PHP** and **MySQL** for server-side and database operations. 

## Features
1. **Dashboard:** View financial news and performance summaries of NASDAQ stocks for in-depth analysis.  

2. **Search & Trade:** Search individual stock and analyse detailed candlestick and RSI charts with scrollable time frame. Users can start buying and selling stocks with the virtual balance allocated to them upon creating an account.  

3. **Wallet:** Top up virtual balance upon exhausted and view trading history for further analysis.  

4. **Portfolio:** Review performance summaries of holdings with RSI chart to consider subsequent trades.
